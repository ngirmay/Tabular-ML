Paper: McLaughlin RT, Asthana M, Di Meo M, Ceccarelli M, Jacob HJ, Masica DL. Fast, accurate, and racially unbiased pan-cancer tumor-only variant calling with tabular machine learning. NPJ Precis Oncol. 2023 Jan 7;7(1):4. doi: 10.1038/s41698-022-00340-1. PMID: 36611079; PMCID: PMC9825621.

Goal: 
- Apply machine learning (TabNet, XGboost, LighGBM) to task of somatic v. germline tumor only variant calling 
- accurately distinguish somatic v. germline mutations to address issue of inflated TMB scores of under represented groups across germline databases

End Result: 
- All 3 models achieved "sate of the art" performance on holdout test datasets (TCGA)
- racial bias was eliminated with ML approach 

Models: 

TabNet: Deep learning model created by google in 2019 to outperform tree-based models 
XGboost: Gradient boosted decision tree library (level-wise tree growth) 
LightGBM: Histogram-based algorithm - gradient boosted model (leaf-wise tree growth) 

Introduction: 
- As shown in Supplementary Figure 1: an issue with calling somatic v. germline mutations is the overlap of true germline v. true somatic mutations.
This leading to a high false positive rate in patients with tumor-only somatic variant calling
- matched normals are not always easy to aquire 
- models were trained using somatic variant pupeline as well as matched normal pipeline (Figure 1) 

Training Set Construction: 
- 105 tumor samples across 7 cancer types 
- sequenced with Agilent Kit 

Validation Set: 
- 45 tumor samples with 3 cancer types absent from training type 
- sequenced with SeqCAP 

Results: 
- Sensitivity and Specificity across patient level performance varies per cancer subtype 
- AUC's of 0.96 (TabNet) 0.99 (XGboost), 0.98 (LightGBM)
- All models perform better on SNV's than indels 
- concordance increased with all models as compared to the naive approach 
- racial bias was elimated for XGboost and LightGBM model - slight bias with TabNet - and slight bias with PureCN 
- run times were significantly faster for ML models v. PureCN although PureCN is larger piece of software in R that performs more actions
- most important features were not related to ontology which could explain elimination of racial bias of databases 

Discussion and further Notes: 
- increase in capture kits used and increase with training set size and diversity will improve model performance 
- No algorithm will be as good as matched normal 

Project Idea: 
- Use three models disscussed in paper to predict drug resistance of common oncogenes
